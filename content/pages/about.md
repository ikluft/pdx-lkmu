The Portland Linux Kernel Meetup used to only be organized on Meetup. But we set up this github.io site for a separate web presence, particularly to generate calendar events that can export to the Portland tech community's Calagator calendar.

Our regular meeting place is Lucky Labrador Beer Hall, 1945 NW Quimby St, Portland, Oregon

Here's the intro as Drew posted it on Meetup:

Come enjoy a beverage and chat with other people who are interested in the Linux kernel. All experience levels are welcome. This is a friendly and casual meetup.

NOTE: Look for the table with a plush Tux as seen in the photo above. Drew's mobile is 773-710-7131 if you have trouble finding us.
