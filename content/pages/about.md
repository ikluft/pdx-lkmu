The Portland Linux Kernel Meetup used to only be organized on [a Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/portland-linux-kernel-meetup/). But we set up this github.io site for a separate web presence, particularly to generate calendar events that can export to the Portland tech community's Calagator calendar.

Our regular meeting place is Lucky Labrador Beer Hall, 1945 NW Quimby St, Portland, Oregon

Here's the intro as Drew posted it on Meetup:

> ![Tux at Lucky Lab]({static}/images/luckylab_tux.webp)

> There are a lot of people in the Portland area that work on and are interested in the Linux kernel - from small, battery-powered embedded systems to big servers with a bunch of cores running the cloud. Let's get together and talk about our favorite kernel!
>
> I moved from Berlin to Portland in November of 2020, so I have yet to meet many of the Linux kernel folks in the area. I thought this Summer would be be a good time to get a meetup group going. I am thinking we could start off with some casual meetups similar to a mixer at local bar or restaurant with outdoor seating. Depending on what people think, we could find a quieter location with a projector and start asking for people interested in giving presentations. I hope to meet you all soon!

This is the text Drew uses for each meetup event:

> Come enjoy a beverage and chat with other people who are interested in the Linux kernel. All experience levels are welcome. This is a friendly and casual meetup.

> NOTE: Look for the table with a plush Tux as seen in the photo above. Drew's mobile is 773-710-7131 if you have trouble finding us.
