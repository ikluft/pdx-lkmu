This site gives the organizers of the Portland Linux Kernel Meetup a place to post info outside of the Meetup.com site we've used since Drew started the meetup in 2021. In particular we'll maintain an iCalendar file of past and future events which can be exported to Calagator, the Portland tech community calendar site.
