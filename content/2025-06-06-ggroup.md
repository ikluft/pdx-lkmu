Drew created a Google Groups mail list/discussion area for planning the dates of the Portland Linux Kernel Meetups. His mailings to everyone involved were getting to be too big a distribution to do manually. It requires permission to be added. So please set expectations that this is something where approval to join comes after attending a meetup.
